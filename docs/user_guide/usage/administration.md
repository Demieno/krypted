# Admin Panel
The administration panel is a feature of Django, and can be accessed by going to `https://<your_site>/admin`. This is where you set up package instances (e.g Discord and EVE Online), interact with the backend database, and create configuration for all Krypted packages. 

Understanding the administration panel is key to using the Krypted platform.
