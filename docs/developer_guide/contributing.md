# Contributing
Krypted accepts contributions in the form of **extensions**, which are essentially our word for [reusable Django Applications](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/reusable-apps/). All of our community packages can be found [here](../features/community_extensions/index).

There are a few requirements to become a community package,
1. The application must separate, with the preferred installation being `pip3 install <krypted-extension>`
2. The application must have test cases, with decent coverage. 
3. The application must be open source.

Community packages that are well put together can be included in the base repository as Git submodules.
