# Krypted Auth
Advanced authentication system for Krypted Gaming.

# Description
Over the years of playing video games, Krypted Gaming has used many tools to integrate with our main games. Linking characters to accounts, assigning groups across a multitude of services, and broadcasting tailored events to each game has been a constant struggle for us. This web application is the all-in-one solution for everything Krypted.

# Design Goals
- Modular (add support for any new games we have)

- Beautiful (looking good on the web is important to us)

- Intuitive (no complicated UIs with poor help text)
